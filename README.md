[AbvOS](https://tondy67.github.io/abvos/) is a fully decentralized [loosely coupled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling) distributed search engine and social network where the user control everything.

Abv (абв) are the first three letters in the [bulgarian alphabet cyrillic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script)

Technically speaking AbvOS is a [Websockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) based [client-server architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model) where every server is a node and every client is a agent/nomad and every group of clients is a clan in the AbvOS terminology

## Some key points of interest.

* The user own his browsing history, bookmarks, searches, files, friends list etc on his device/s.
* Every message is encrypted.
* There is no tracking/logging system and no connection between nodes.
* Nobody can watch user activity except his friends
* The user with his clan of friends can jump freely like nomads from node to node.
* The user can ban/delete everybody from his clan
* The user or node owner can advertise something if want
* The user may be a human or a bot
* The node can be started even in android phone
* As a side effect, this design will cut the spread of fake news around the world
