# abvos

[AbvOS](https://tondy67.github.io/abvos/) is a fully decentralized [loosely coupled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling) distributed search engine and social network where the user control everything.

Abv (абв) are the first three letters in the [bulgarian alphabet cyrillic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script)

Technically speaking AbvOS is a [Websockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) based [client-server architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model) where every server is a node and every client is a agent/nomad and every group of clients is a clan in the AbvOS terminology

## Some key points of interest.

* The user own his browsing history, bookmarks, searches, files, friends list etc on his device/s.
* Every message is encrypted.
* There is no tracking/logging system and no connection between nodes.
* Nobody can watch user activity except his friends
* The user with his clan of friends can jump freely like nomads from node to node.
* The user can ban/delete everybody from his clan
* The user or node owner can advertise something if want
* The user may be a human or a bot
* The node can be started even in android phone
* As a side effect, this design will cut the spread of fake news around the world

### [Live demos](https://tondy67.github.io/abvos/nodes.html)

You can look at AbvOS as spiritual successor of the [Inferno os](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(operating_system)) and its [Styx protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9P_(protocol))

Also despite that I write it in Javascript and C for practical reasons if you are interested in programming I strongly recommend to take a look at [Haxe language](https://haxe.org/). 
AbvOS as haxe born, "[Cherchez la femme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherchez_la_femme)" as always and that fact will be never forgotten. 
I wrote its first components, better said prototypes in haxe and they are archived [here](https://github.com/tondy67/abv-bac).

I also have to mention [Now](https://zeit.co/now), [Heroku](https://heroku.com/), [Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/), [Cloudno.de](https://www.cloudno.de/), [Openode.io](https://openode.io/) because thanks to their generosity I can test my baby and you to see it in action [here](https://tondy67.github.io/abvos/nodes.html). 
There is not much at the moment, be patient. More to come. 

If you like this project which is built on top of [AbvOS](https://tondy67.github.io/abvos/) please consider funding further development by small donation [here](https://tondy.herokuapp.com/store)  and you'll see it an action bay the way :)

That is... :)
